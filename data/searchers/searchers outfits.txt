	description "The Scatergun Anti-Missile Turret is an antiquated design dating back to when the biggest threat to Searcher vessels was small asteroids. Rarely used in those days and painfully slow to adjust elevation, it is still a powerful weapon when it can be brought to bear. At maximum rate of fire, it launches thirty powerful but short-ranged bursts of hyperfocused plasma per second."

	description "Although the Sharpshooter anti-missile system fires far slower than the Scattergun, it more than makes up for this in the range and power of the individual transluminal plasma beams. These carefully concentrated projectiles are nearly indistinguishable from lasers, picking off missiles far before they can get close enough to do any harm."

	description "The Tautology Battery is the largest widely available battery the Searchers' outfitters stock. While larger batteries are occasionally fitted by their captains, this is a rare occurrence. After all, it is easily capable of providing power for all but the very largest ships, and has built up a reputation for reliability and efficiency."

Over time, they added to their early ramscoops, and now these solar collection units are the primary sources of power for their ships."

	description "The SSU-1 Obstuctive Shield Unit is the smallest module of its kind the Searchers make. It is intended for use on Searcher drones, and recharges shields moderately quickly while drawing only a very small amount of power. Unfortunately, to optimize the power usage it was necessary to increase the size of the outfit, so the Obstructive Shield Unit is quite large, as well as expensive."

	description "The SSU-2 Protective Shield Unit is a step up from the most basic Searcher shield generation systems, designed for use in small motherships such as the Searcher Temple. It is even more energy efficient than its smaller cousin, while being marginally smaller and slightly more cost-efficient."

	description "The SSU-3 Effective Shield Unit is designed as a considerably more modern, efficient shield module for Searcher ships. It fits well as a medium-strength module: smaller than the enormous units designed for capital ships, but still powerful enough to be useful."

	"shield generation" 1
	"shield energy" .6
	description "The SSU-4 Reliable Shield Unit has been in use for centuries as a shield module built with small capital ships in mind. It is undeniably large but also quite powerful, comparable to the largest shield generators available in human space. Although it is quite bulky and not quite as energy efficient as the newer SSU-3, the SSU-4 is still a very capable shield generation unit."

	"outfit space" -125
	"shield generation" 1.9
	"shield energy" 1.1
	description "The SSU-5 Adamantine Shield Unit is the largest shield module the Searchers have ever built. It is insanely capable, far more advanced than anything humans have produced, despite its large size. Overall, this outfit is very impressive considering that the Searchers have never fought a major war in space where they needed to use shielding, and that it was originally designed to help protect large ships from asteroids."

	"shields" -100
	description "The Searchers generally build fairly heat-efficient systems, and nowhere is this more obvious than in their single, nearly useless, cooling system. This heat sink wicks away heat from your ship, allowing it to cool slightly faster and hold more heat before overheating. It is also fairly easy to attach, just needing to be bolted on to the outside of your ship and have a couple of ducts run through to where they can accomplish something. Unfortunately, mounting things onto the outside of a ship's hull tends to cause problems with its shield matrix."

	description "As part of how the Searchers' language acquisition process works, they scan and record all audio from nearby ships, using a highly focused laser to pick up on vibrations in the hull of the ship. The scanner they use for that purpose is so powerful that it is also highly effective at performing other types of scans. Unfortunately, it's also quite bulky, so it is not nearly as mass-efficient as a specialized scanner for any specific kind of scan."

This helical railgun has enough recoil that it must be strapped to its user's arm, but it is capable of firing three hundred depleted uranium-tipped flechettes a second in shells containing one hundred each. The railgun runs out of ammo and power quickly, but while it lasts it can do devastating damage to people and armor alike, made worse by the fact that the toxin in the darts is poisonous for most species in the galaxy. Unfortunately, the Helical Flechette Railgun is slightly less useful in defensive engagements, as it has a tendency to destroy valuable pieces of equipment."
